# Welcome

There are many resources online for learning bioinformatics, but sometimes we don't find the actual steps in doing it. My motivation for this repository is to add more resources for _Doing_ Bioinformatics.

It might take months to develop from scratch. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated.
